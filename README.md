# Dimensionality-Reduction-Pipeline
In this project, I utilize Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensioanlity of a Wheat Kernel multivariate dataset using the Support Vector Machine Learning Model. I preprocessed the data, scaled it using StandardScaler, tuned hyperparamters, and finally visualized the results. In the second part, I created a pipeline for the K-means Clustering algorithm.
