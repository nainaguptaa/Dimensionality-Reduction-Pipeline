# Dimensionality-Reduction-Pipeline

In this project, I utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of a Wheat Kernel multivariate dataset and applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning model. The process involved data preprocessing, scaling with StandardScaler, hyperparameter tuning, and result visualization. Additionally, I created a pipeline for the K-means clustering algorithm.
